# Overview

This Community Shaders addon simulates water caustic effects and adds optimized parallax support.

# Features

## Caustics

When underwater (exclusive to large water sources and rivers) you can see **caustics** which become **larger** and **fade out** as you get further underwater.

The shape of caustics **change with the curvature of the surface**, and are disabled at the bottom of objects.

:::

Caustics are created by scrolling and overlapping this texture. It is a loose file which can be replaced by mods.

:yellow[If replacing this texture, please save it as **BC4** to maximize performance.]

## Parallax

Parallax adds **depth** to the water surface to simulate greater detail.

The height of each individual scrolling texture is **added together and blended**. This is a simpler parallax algorithm, specifically designed for **water**.

# Overview

This Community Shaders addon which adds screen-space subsurface scattering to characters, to simulate realistic skin.

# Features

- This subsurface scattering shader is the same as one included in Unreal Engine. It's still used in a lot of games today, including Fallout 4. 
- The subsurface profile is configurable in-game, with one set for human races, and one for beast races. 
- By default, the vanilla character lighting disabled, because it's not very good. This helps make skin shading more realistic.
- This is compatible with all skin and body mods.
- :::yellow[Please note that this subsurface scattering is designed for realistic skin shading.]

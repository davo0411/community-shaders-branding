Normal text is size 3, what Nexus calls "Normal." It uses the default font, color, and weight. Text can be emphasized in several ways.

- Use **bold** for heavy emphasis, like the beginning of a bullet point.
- Use _italic_ for more subtle emphasis.
- Avoid underlines.
- ~~Strikethroughs~~ may be used to reference information that is no longer valid, but is kept for around as a callout that a change has occurred.

# Section

A section uses a blue header, is bold, and is in all caps, size 5. The font is Trebuchet. There should be a line between the header and its contents.

- Use a bullet list to organize features, but keep the lines short.
  - You can use indented bullets, but do so sparingly.
  - Don't use more than 1 level of indenting.
- **Bold Text** can be used within lists to draw the eye to specific key words.
- If you are making any list of things, use bullets and not plain paragraphs.

## DETAILS

Subsections use a very light gray color, are in all caps, size 4. The font is still Trebuchet.

Any section can contain [links]() or inline images/videos as necessary. Images and videos should be _centered_. Consider adding a caption directly below images and videos using a smaller font.

For example:

:::center
![Riverwood](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/skyrim_gamepedia/images/c/c1/Riverwood1.jpg)

:small[The Dragonborn enters Riverwood]
:::

# Another section

:yellow[This is a sub-header for a section. It can be used to set the tone of the section, or summarize what the reader is about to read.]

This yellow color can be used for emphasis in other areas as well. It should always use the default font and size 3, but any other emphasis is allowed.

_**:yellow[This is an important callout!]**_

You'll want to pay attention to that callout up there.

You can also use colors to draw attention to critical information:

- **:green[Compatible with all mods that don't affect Nazeem]**
- **:red[WARNING: If you like Nazeem, don't install this mod!]**

Try not to go too crazy with colors. They can be good to break up the flow of white text, but too many dense colors can be harder to read.
